# Cross-Platform Parity

Discount Screener has two user-facing clients: the Rust desktop app and the Android app.

## Default Rule

User-visible functionality should be kept in 1:1 parity across both clients by default.

- If a feature is added to Android, add the equivalent feature to the Rust desktop app.
- If a feature is added to the Rust desktop app, add the equivalent feature to Android.
- Differences in UI styling or implementation detail are fine. Differences in product capability are not the default.

## Exceptions

One-platform changes are allowed only when the request explicitly says so or when the platform cannot support the behavior.

- Call out the exception clearly in the task or pull request.
- Update the relevant docs so the exception is obvious to future editors.
- Keep shared behavior in shared contracts or other platform-neutral code when practical.

## Review Check

Before finishing a feature, verify that:

- both clients expose the same user-visible behavior, or
- the scope is explicitly documented as Android-only or desktop-only.
